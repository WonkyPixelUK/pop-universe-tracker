## üîß Manual Setup Required in Supabase Dashboard

Since the database is connected via MCP, please create these storage buckets manually:

### Storage Buckets to Create:

#### 1. **funko-images** bucket
```sql
-- Bucket Configuration:
- Name: funko-images
- Public: true
- File size limit: 5MB (5242880 bytes)
- Allowed MIME types: image/*
```

#### 2. **profile-images** bucket  
```sql
-- Bucket Configuration:
- Name: profile-images
- Public: true
- File size limit: 5MB (5242880 bytes)
- Allowed MIME types: image/*
```

### RLS Policies to Create:

#### For **funko-images** bucket:
```sql
-- Policy 1: Anyone can view funko images
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view funko images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'funko-images');

-- Policy 2: Authenticated users can upload funko images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload funko images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'funko-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy 3: Users can update their own funko images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own funko images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'funko-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Policy 4: Users can delete their own funko images  
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own funko images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'funko-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

#### For **profile-images** bucket:
```sql
-- Policy 1: Anyone can view profile images
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'profile-images');

-- Policy 2: Authenticated users can upload profile images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'profile-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy 3: Users can update their own profile images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'profile-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Policy 4: Users can delete their own profile images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'profile-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## üéØ How to Test

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:8084/test-enhanced-collection
3. **Test Funko Pop Image Upload**:
   - Click "Add to Collection (Enhanced)"
   - Go to "Manual Entry" tab
   - Upload an image in the "Funko Pop Image" section
   - Fill out the form and submit

4. **Test Profile Picture Upload**:
   - Go to Profile Settings
   - Use the new ImageUpload component for avatar

## üìÅ File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ImageUpload.tsx           # ‚úÖ NEW: Reusable image upload component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EnhancedAddItemDialog.tsx # ‚úÖ UPDATED: Added image upload
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProfileEditor.tsx         # ‚úÖ UPDATED: Uses ImageUpload component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TestEnhancedCollection.tsx # ‚úÖ UPDATED: Shows new features
```

## üîë Key Features

- **Secure**: Images stored with user ID prefix for privacy
- **Validated**: File type and size validation on frontend
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes  
- **Accessible**: Proper labels and keyboard navigation
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for users
- **Consistent**: Same upload experience across the app

## üí° Implementation Notes

- Images are stored with unique filenames: `{userId}/{timestamp}-{randomId}.{extension}`
- File validation happens before upload to save bandwidth
- Public URLs are generated automatically for easy display
- The component handles all states: idle, uploading, success, error
- Drag & drop provides modern UX while click-to-upload remains available

Once the storage buckets are created in Supabase dashboard, the image upload functionality will work seamlessly! üöÄ
